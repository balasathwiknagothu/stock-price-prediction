## Project Title
Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Stock market data is highly dynamic and continuously changing, making it difficult for users to analyze trends and make informed decisions using raw data alone. Most beginner-level projects rely on static datasets and lack real-time updates, limiting their practical relevance.

This project aims to design and implement an end-to-end, real-time stock price prediction system that automatically fetches live stock market data at regular intervals, processes and stores the data efficiently, applies machine learning models for prediction, and presents the results through a user-friendly web interface accessible via a browser.

## Project Objectives
- Fetch live stock market data from reliable external sources
- Automatically update stock data every 15 minutes
- Store and manage historical and recent stock data efficiently
- Perform feature engineering on stock data
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction
- Expose predictions through a backend API
- Build a user-friendly web interface for interaction
- Host the application online for public access
- Maintain proper version control using GitHub
- Create detailed technical documentation for clarity and reproducibility

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Real-time stock data collection (15-minute intervals)
- Use of multiple stock data sources
- Machine learning-based price prediction
- Backend development using Flask
- Frontend web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Cloud deployment of the application
- GitHub-based version control
- Detailed documentation and project logs

### Out of Scope
- High-frequency trading
- Guaranteed financial predictions
- Paid stock market APIs
- Real-money trading integration
- Mobile application development (initial phase)

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
- Stock data is fetched and updated automatically every 15 minutes
- The system runs without manual intervention
- Machine learning models produce reasonable predictions based on historical trends
- Users can interact with the system via a browser
- The application is publicly accessible through a hosted URL
- The complete project code is available on GitHub
- Documentation clearly explains system architecture, data flow, and model behavior
